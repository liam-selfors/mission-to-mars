# mission-to-mars

The purpose of this repository is to adjust a web app to include four hemisphere images. BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
